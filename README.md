This is a WIP that aims to replicate OS desktops visually using HTML, CSS and Javascript.

## How to run

* Download the repo to your computer
* run `npm install` and then `npm-start`
* Open your browser at `http://localhost:3000`

Currently the only OS being developed is Windows Vista, which can be accessed on `http://localhost:3000/vista` or by clicking the hyperlink in the homepage.
